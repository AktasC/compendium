### Introduction

> Hi, eryone! This a Yi Long Ma !

Welcome to my collection of notes and scripts for my home server setup, basically an overpowered notepad to save me the pain of rebuilding it from scratch.\
Think of it as my personal collection of cheatsheets.\
_Also, I'm not a native English speaker, bear with me or eat a baguette._

### Disclaimer

Heads up, I'm a software engineer by trade, but more on the business side these days.\
So, don't expect fancy devOps or sysadmin stuff. I haven't mastered that magic yet. 🤡\
That being said, I've been using Linux for over 10 years and started my dev journey with the glorious C programming language.

This ain't a fancy guide with details, explanations, all the bells and whistles.\
It'll have its share of bumps and detours – that's the fun of learning, right?

But before you dive in, remember:

* **Brush up first**\
  Before you get started, consider learning the basics of Debian, SSH, LXC, reverse proxies, and Docker.\
  I really won't go much into technical details, the more you know the better it is.
* **Copy-pasting is risky**\
  Our setups might differ (hardware, anyone?), so adapt these guides as needed.\
  For example, the way you enable PCI passthrough isn't the same whether your CPU's from Intel or AMD.

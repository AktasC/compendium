### Introduction

Welcome to my personal compendium or wiki, basically an overpowered notepad to save me the pain of researching things I've already done and forgot about.\
This site isn‚Äôt meant to be your go-to for exhaustive, hand-holding tutorials ; instead, it‚Äôs a living, breathing collection of my technical experiments and solutions.

_I'm not a native English speaker so please bear with me, or eat a baguette idk ü•ñ_

### Disclaimer

I'm a software engineer who‚Äôs shifted more toward the platfrom architecture side lately.\
So, while you won‚Äôt find deep-dives into fancy DevOps or SysAdmin wizardry here (I'm still learning those dark arcanes), you can bet there's plenty of tech know-how.\
I've been rocking Linux for over 10 years and started my coding journey with good old C with CodeBlocks, so there's solid experience ~~(and suffering)~~ behind these notes :saluting\_face:

**Before You Dive In:**

* **Gear Up:**\
  I won't always break down every script or snippet, so make sure you're comfortable with the basics.\
  Think Debian, SSH, LXC, reverse proxies and Docker.
* **Copy-Paste Caution:**\
  Our setups can vary (hardware, anyone?), so you'll need to tweak these ""guides"" to fit your environment.\
  For instance, enabling PCI passthrough often depends on a combination of hardware and software.\
  Blind copy-pasting might lead to "unexpected hiccups", you've been warned.
* **Your Call:**\
  Use the information here at your own risk.\
  I‚Äôm sharing what works for me, but you‚Äôre responsible for how you apply it and what you do of it.

If you have suggestions or spot something off, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the GitHub repository.

# ðŸª± Debian

## Pre-Requisites

### Basic Knowledge

As I stated in the [#introduction](../../#introduction "mention") seciton, I've been distrohopping for quite a long time.\
This means that I won't be writing how you should use Rufus or `dd` to flash a USB drive, use Ventoy or install Debian; all of those things are / should be pretty basic knowledge at this point.

In my humble opinion, if you can't do those things without using a guide, you've got better things to do than reading this.

Once you've got [Proxmox installed](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation), things can finally start.

# ðŸŽ¥ Plex

While I'll locally store symlinks to the files on Real-Debrid, and thus shouldn't need that much storage, Plex takes space proportionally to your library's size (mainly to store metadata).\
That partially explains why I bumped up both the vCPU, RAM, Swap and storage allocations compared to what's set by default.\
For example, I've seen the LXC briefly spike up to 6.3GB of RAM usage by times, though the average usage has been orbiting around 1GB for the past year.

***

For simplicity's sake I'll be using[ @tteck's scripts for Proxmox-VE](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/)

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/plex.sh)"
```

This will create an LXC dedicated to Plex Media Server and allocate it 2G of RAM, 8G of storage and 2 vCores by default.\
Personally, I'll adjust the allocated ressources such as:

* RAM: 4096 MB
* Swap: 2048 MB
* Storage: 128 GB
* CPU: 6 vCores

***

Through the Proxmox GUI:

* Go to the `Options` section of your LXC
* Click on `Features`
* Enable `FUSE`

Once you're done, head to your LXC's `console`

```bash
# Installing basic tools.
apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade -y; apt-get install curl git micro
```

```bash
micro /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set `PermitRootLogin` to `yes`&#x20;

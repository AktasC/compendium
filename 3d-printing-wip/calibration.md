## Filament Calibration

**Don't forget to calibrate your printer first.**\
As I have a Bambulab P1S, I'll simply run the 30mn calibration process.

**Start fresh**. Create a new generic filament profile.\
&#xNAN;_&#x42;rands update their recipes so the PLA you buy right now from X might not be the same as the "same" ones you bought 3 years ago._

### Temperature

First things first: find the ideal temperature in the "normal" range given by the manufacturer.

Look for overhangs first, then bridges and finally overall surface quality.

Once you found the proper temperature:

* Update the filament profile accordingly.\
  `First Layer Temp = Ideal Temperature + 5°C`
* Save your profile & quit the project.

### Flow Rate

* Run the YOLO test included in Orca Slicer.
* Update your filament profile accordingly.

_Proceed again if you're really picky and think quality might get even better._

### Pressure Advance

### Retraction&#x20;

### Max Volumetric Speed
